- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client that has created an application that they wanted to expand into having a web-based version as well. They wanted this software
to be able to be ran from multiple operating systems, and for multiple games to be able to be run at the same time (using identifiers), with multiple
players able to be on the same game. 

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
For the Evaluation and Recommendation section of the documentation, there had to be lots of research to ensure that the information was as 
accurate as possible. One thing that I believe I should of added to the documentation however would be a bibliography, so that I would be able to 
have a record of where I retrieved the information from.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a UML Diagram proved to be very helpful during development since it served as a good overview of how the various classes would
work together in the final product. Along with showing what variables or functions should be expected.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the Evaluation portion of the document, and I'd improve on it by expanding on the Development Tools and not just name the tools and
languages, but give a brief description of how they are used so that someone not familar with the programs can see how they help with development.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are important to consider during the design process because they are the ones that would be using the program, not the developers creating it.
Their needs would be considered at each step of the process and would range from functional features that would be expected to be present as well as ensuring
that the UI allows them to easily use the program.
